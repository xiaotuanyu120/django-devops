module: nxos_template
version_added: "2.1"
author: "Peter Sprygada (@privateip)"
short_description: Manage Cisco NXOS device configurations
description:
  - Manages network device configurations over SSH or NXAPI.  This module
    allows implementors to work with the device running-config.  It
    provides a way to push a set of commands onto a network device
    by evaluting the current running-config and only pushing configuration
    commands that are not already configured.  The config source can
    be a set of commands or a template.
extends_documentation_fragment: nxos
options:
  src:
    description:
      - The path to the config source.  The source can be either a
        file with config or a template that will be merged during
        runtime.  By default the task will search for the source
        file in role or playbook root folder in templates directory.
    required: false
    default: null
  force:
    description:
      - The force argument instructs the module to not consider the
        current devices running-config.  When set to true, this will
        cause the module to push the contents of I(src) into the device
        without first checking if already configured.
    required: false
    default: false
    choices: [ "true", "false" ]
  include_defaults:
    description:
      - The module, by default, will collect the current device
        running-config to use as a base for comparision to the commands
        in I(src).  Setting this value to true will cause the module
        to issue the command `show running-config all` to include all
        device settings.
    required: false
    default: false
    choices: [ "true", "false" ]
  backup:
    description:
      - When this argument is configured true, the module will backup
        the running-config from the node prior to making any changes.
        The backup file will be written to backup_{{ hostname }} in
        the root of the playbook directory.
    required: false
    default: false
    choices: [ "true", "false" ]
  config:
    description:
      - The module, by default, will connect to the remote device and
        retrieve the current running-config to use as a base for comparing
        against the contents of source.  There are times when it is not
        desirable to have the task get the current running-config for
        every task in a playbook.  The I(config) argument allows the
        implementer to pass in the configuruation to use as the base
        config for comparision.
    required: false
    default: null
