module: ops_command
version_added: "2.1"
author: "Peter sprygada (@privateip)"
short_description: Run arbitrary commands on OpenSwitch devices.
description:
  - Sends arbitrary commands to an OpenSwitch node and returns the results
    read from the device. The M(ops_command) module includes an
    argument that will cause the module to wait for a specific condition
    before returning or timing out if the condition is not met.

options:
  commands:
    description:
      - List of commands to send to the remote ops device over the
        configured provider. The resulting output from the command
        is returned. If the I(waitfor) argument is provided, the
        module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or
        the number of retires as expired.
    required: true
  waitfor:
    description:
      - List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the
        command. The task will wait for a each condition to be true
        before moving forward. If the conditional is not true
        within the configured number of retries, the task fails.
        See examples.
    required: false
    default: null
  retries:
    description:
      - Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried
        before it is considered failed. The command is run on the
        target device every retry and evaluated against the
        waitfor conditions.
    required: false
    default: 10
  interval:
    description:
      - Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries
        of the command. If the command does not pass the specified
        conditions, the interval indicates how long to wait before
        trying the command again.
    required: false
    default: 1
